# Credit-Management-System
System traversal:- index->users->views->transfer->users

# Use
Managing credits between different users using basic and simple web designing technologies like HTML,CSS,PHP,MySQL.
Assuming for each user there is a specific ID and Name, the Sender is supposed to be selected from the table given in users.php.
The sender is then directed to views.php where previous transactions sent by sender are shown. 
The sender can then input Receiver's name and ID along with credits to be transferred.
Transaction is successful only if name and ID correspond to the right receiver i.e Receiver credentials should be in the database.
If credentials are wrong, transaction fails. In either case, Sender is redirected to users.php.
The users.php page is updated (new credit information for sender and receiver) after successful transaction.

I have hosted this system at https://app-1539582512.000webhostapp.com/TSF1/index.html so feel free to check out. 
Any suggestions will be happily welcomed.
